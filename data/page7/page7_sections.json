I define the effective reproduction number Rt in the NSIR model analogously.

Using (1), in the (no-intervention) NSIR model we have, At p = 1 this expression equals RSIR t but in general, including at t = 0, the NSIR model reproduction number RNSIR differs from RSIR and depends on the graph G. For example, [9] t t emphasize the importance of the ratio between the second and first moment of the degree dis- tribution for the infection growth rate. 2.3.2 Population vs. network transmission. I next compare the reproduction numbers for the SIR model (p = 1) and the network-only transmission NSIR model (p = 0) for given val- ues of It and St. Using (6), for p = 0 we have rIt Pi2Stsit\u00d6G\u00dc is the average chance of infection across all susceptible nodes i 2 St at time t, given the set I t of infectious agents i with xit = I. Comparing (5) and (7), observe that t \u22db RSIR t , st\u00d6G\u00dc\u22db It Intuitively, the standard SIR model assumes a uniform chance of infection for each suscepti- ble agent which is proportional to the population infection rate It N. In contrast, in the network- augmented NSIR model an individual's chance of infection is heterogeneous and is a function of the social network G. The average time-t infection probability in the network, st\u00d6G\u00dc deter- mines the reproduction number RNSIR . For example, consider the first infection, I0 = 1 of some t agent i0, at which RSIR r.
